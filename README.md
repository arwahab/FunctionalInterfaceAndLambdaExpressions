# FunctionalInterfaceAndLambdaExpressions

/* Java - 8
 * 
 * Functional Interface has ONLY 1 abstract method
 * Meaning that the interface implementation will only have 1 behavior
 * FI ex: java.lang.Runnable,
 *           java.util.Comparator,
 *           java.util.Callable,
 *           java.io.FileFilter
 * 
 * A FI can have multiple default methods but ONLY 1 abstract method
 *
 * Lambda expressions can represent instance of a FI
 *
